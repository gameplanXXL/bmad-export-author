## 4. SCAFFOLDING STRATEGY

### Support Structures

#### Worked Examples (Expert Modeling)

**Where Used:** Beginning of each week and complex new skill

**Purpose:** Reduce cognitive load by showing complete expert process before expecting independent execution. Readers see the 'what' and 'how' modeled before attempting themselves.

**Example:** Day 1: Complete worked example of author building their first palace with floor plan, station descriptions, encoding decisions visible.

#### Palace Builder Templates

**Where Used:** Week 1 Day 1, Week 3 Day 18 (presentation mapping)

**Purpose:** Provide structured worksheets to guide palace creation, reducing planning burden. Readers fill in template rather than starting from blank page.

#### Troubleshooting Checklists

**Where Used:** End of each week, Chapter 6 extensively

**Purpose:** Enable self-correction without needing instructor. Diagnostic questions guide readers to identify and fix own problems.

**Example:** "Can't recall item at Station 5?" → Is your route consistent? Y/N → Is the image vivid enough? Y/N → Did you create interaction with location? Y/N

#### Success Check Binary Gates

**Where Used:** End of every daily exercise

**Purpose:** Immediate formative feedback. Readers know if they're ready to advance or need to repeat.

**Example:** "Can you recall all 10 items forwards AND backwards? YES → Continue / NO → Repeat exercise"

#### Mastery Gates (Week-End Assessments)

**Where Used:** Day 7, 14, 21, 28

**Purpose:** Prevent advancement without prerequisite mastery. Ensures solid foundation before adding complexity.

**Example:** Week 1 Gate: Must achieve 90% recall of 10-item palace forwards/backwards before Week 2. Explicit instruction: "If you don't meet criteria, repeat Week 1 exercises."

### Gradual Release of Responsibility

#### Week 1: 80% Instructor Support → 20% Independence

- Explicit step-by-step instructions
- Multiple worked examples
- High structure, low ambiguity

#### Week 2: 60% Support → 40% Independence

- Clear objectives, readers make more decisions
- Some materials provided, readers customize
- Moderate structure

#### Week 3: 40% Support → 60% Independence

- Strategic guidance, readers execute
- Readers supply most content
- Low structure, high autonomy

#### Week 4: 20% Support → 80% Independence

- Open challenges, readers self-direct
- Minimal instructions, coaching frameworks
- Readers become own instructors

#### Post-Book (90 days): 5% Support → 95% Independence

## 5. ASSESSMENT STRATEGY

### Formative Assessments (Ongoing)

#### Daily Success Checks

**Frequency:** Every single day (28 total)

**Purpose:** Immediate feedback loop. Readers know if they succeeded before moving forward. Prevents cascading failure from weak foundations.

**Format:** Binary Y/N question: "Can you perform X?" with specific success criteria

**Example:** "Day 2: Can you mentally walk your palace route smoothly in under 1 minute? Y/N"

#### Weekly Self-Assessment Checklists

**Frequency:** End of each week (4 total)

**Purpose:** Comprehensive review of week's skills. Multi-item checklist ensures nothing was missed.

**Format:** Checkbox list with action items if unchecked

#### Reflection Prompts

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week

**Purpose:** Develop metacognitive awareness. Readers think about their thinking, identify patterns, build self-coaching ability.

**Examples:**
- "What was most difficult today? Why do you think that was?"
- "Which station in your palace is most vivid? What makes it memorable?"
- "How did you feel using this in a real situation?"

### Summative Assessments (Milestone)

#### Weekly Mastery Tests

**Placement:** Day 7, 14, 21, 28 (end of each week)

**Evaluates:** Cumulative competency in that week's focus area

**Format:** Performance-based: Build, encode, recall under specified conditions

| Week | Test | Pass Criteria |
|------|------|---------------|
| 1 | 10-item palace | 90%+ recall forwards/backwards |
| 2 | 20-25 names+faces | 85%+ recall after 24h |
| 3 | Presentation delivery | 15-20 min from memory, 3 palaces managed |
| 4 | Comprehensive | New palace in 10 min, 25 items 90%+ recall, real application |

#### Final Transformation Assessment (Day 28)

**Evaluates:** Overall achievement of BBD transformation promise

**Format:** Before/After comparison + Comprehensive skill test

**Success Criteria:**
- Can remember 20+ names reliably
- Can present 15-20 min freely without notes
- Feels mentally more organized
- Uses technique daily in work

### Self-Assessment Tools

#### 30-Day Progress Tracker

**Purpose:** Visual representation of journey. Readers check off each day completed, see momentum building.

**Format:** Calendar grid with daily checkboxes + weekly milestone markers

#### Skill Level Rubrics

**Purpose:** Help readers evaluate their own proficiency level for each skill.

**Example:**

**Skill: Mental Palace Route Rehearsal**
- **Beginner:** Can walk route but with hesitation, takes 2+ minutes
- **Developing:** Can walk route smoothly in ~1 minute, occasional uncertainty
- **Competent:** Route is automatic, <30 seconds, no hesitation, forwards/backwards
- **Mastery:** Can jump directly to any station, visualize from any angle

#### Real-World Application Log

**Purpose:** Track actual usage in work situations. Reinforces transfer and provides success evidence.

**Format:** Week | Date | Situation | What I Remembered | Success? (1-10)

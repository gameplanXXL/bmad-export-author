## 6. PRACTICE ARCHITECTURE

### Practice Philosophy

**Deliberate Practice Approach:**
- Practice is structured, not random
- Each exercise targets specific skill component
- Difficulty calibrated to stretch but not break
- Immediate feedback on performance
- Repetition with variation to build flexibility
- Real-world application emphasized from Day 6 onward

**Quantity:** 28 daily exercises (20-30 min each) = ~12-14 hours total practice

**Quality:** Every minute purposeful, no busy work

---

### Practice Progression

#### Highly Guided Practice (Week 1, Days 1-7)

**Characteristics:**
- Explicit step-by-step instructions
- Provided practice materials (lists, items to encode)
- Worked examples precede every new skill
- Success criteria crystal clear
- High support, low ambiguity

#### Structured but Flexible Practice (Week 2, Days 8-14)

**Characteristics:**
- Clear objectives but more reader choice
- Some materials provided, readers source others
- Readers adapt techniques to their context
- Instructions guide but don't dictate every step
- Moderate support

#### Applied Practice with Coaching (Week 3, Days 15-21)

**Characteristics:**
- Real-world scenarios, readers supply content
- Minimal step-by-step, more strategic guidance
- Readers make most decisions independently
- Troubleshooting support available but not intrusive

#### Autonomous Practice (Week 4, Days 22-28)

**Characteristics:**
- Open-ended challenges
- Readers define their own goals and approaches
- Self-directed problem-solving
- Coaching frameworks provided but readers drive

### Practice Variety

| Exercise Type | Learning Style | Cognitive Level | Purpose |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Isolated Skill Drills** | Kinesthetic, procedural | Remember, Understand | Build component skills to automaticity |
| **Integration Exercises** | Analytical, systematic | Apply | Combine components into cohesive skill |
| **Case Study Analysis** | Visual, narrative | Analyze | See technique in context, inspire application ideas |
| **Real-World Application** | Practical, experiential | Apply, Evaluate | Transfer learning to authentic contexts |
| **Reflection & Metacognition** | Introspective, verbal | Evaluate, Create | Develop self-awareness and autonomous problem-solving |
| **Assessments & Challenges** | Competitive, goal-oriented | Analyze, Evaluate | Measure progress, motivate achievement |

## 7. FEEDBACK MECHANISMS

### Built-In Feedback

#### Binary Success Checks (Daily)

**Location:** End of every daily exercise

**Type:** Self-assessment with clear criteria

**Example:** "Can you recall all 10 items forwards AND backwards?" → YES: Congratulations! Proceed to Day 6. → NO: That's okay. Repeat today's exercise tomorrow before advancing.

**Purpose:** Immediate knowledge of results, prevents false confidence

#### Troubleshooting Decision Trees

**Location:** End of each week, extensively in Week 4

**Type:** Diagnostic guidance → corrective strategies

**Example:** "Struggling with recall?" → Route not consistent? → Solution: Re-walk physical location, reinforce stations

**Purpose:** Enable self-correction without instructor dependency

#### Worked Example Comparisons

**Location:** After reader attempts exercise

**Type:** Compare reader's approach to expert model

**Purpose:** Calibrate reader's performance against expert standard

#### Assessment Rubrics

**Location:** Weekly mastery tests

**Type:** Scoring criteria with descriptors

**Example:**

**Week 2 Name Recall Assessment:**
- **90-100% recall:** Excellent mastery
- **75-89% recall:** Good progress, review weak encodings
- **60-74% recall:** Developing, repeat Week 2 exercises
- **<60% recall:** Foundational issues, revisit Week 1

**Purpose:** Clear feedback on proficiency level + action steps

---

### Reflection Prompts

**Frequency:** 2-3 times per week, 56+ total prompts

**Purpose:** Develop metacognitive awareness—readers think about their learning process, identify patterns, build self-coaching capacity.

**Examples:**
- "What was most challenging about today's exercise? Why?"
- "Which of your palace stations is most vivid? What makes it memorable?"
- "When you forgot an item, what do you think went wrong?"
- "How did it feel to use this technique in a real situation?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"

**Integration:** Prompts embedded directly in daily exercises, not separate activities. 1-2 minutes of reflection after practice.

- Better modular organization needed
- Typically after Phase 2 (Learning Architecture) or Phase 5 (QA)

**What it does**:
- Analyzes document structure semantically
- Proposes intelligent splitting strategy
- Creates subdirectory with modules (~150-250 lines each)
- Generates master `README.md` with navigation
- Uses meaningful filenames (not generic numbering)

**Example result**:
```
docs/
├── learning-framework/
│   ├── README.md                    # Master index & navigation

│   ├── learning-progression.md      # ~220 lines
│   ├── outcomes-by-chapter.md       # ~420 lines
│   └── exercise-design.md           # ~180 lines
```

**Benefits**:
- ⚡ Faster loading for Claude Code agents
- 🧭 Better navigation with indexes
- 📝 Easier maintenance of focused modules
- 🎯 Load only needed sections

## Key Principles

1. **Sequential Foundation**: Book Blueprint must be completed before learning design
2. **Specification-Driven Writing**: Author works from detailed specifications
3. **Iterative Quality**: Review-revise cycle for each chapter
4. **Checkpoint Approvals**: Major transitions require review/approval
5. **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent focuses on their domain
6. **Document-Centric**: Book Blueprint is single source of truth
7. **Modular Organization**: Large documents can be sharded for better maintainability

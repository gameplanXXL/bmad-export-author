# BMAD Expert Author Expansion Pack

## Overview

The **BMAD Expert Author Expansion Pack** extends the BMAD-METHODâ„¢ framework with specialized AI agents designed to help authors create high-quality, transformative non-fiction books that enable readers to master practical skills.

This expansion pack provides a complete toolkit for creating educational books that combine compelling narratives, practical exercises, and proven learning methodologies.

## Core Philosophy

This expansion pack is built on proven instructional design principles:

- **ADDIE Model** - Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, Evaluation for systematic learning design
- **Practice-Based Learning** - Hands-on exercises, worksheets, and real-world applications
- **Transformation-Focused** - Clear before/after outcomes with measurable skill progression
- **Accessibility** - Making complex skills learnable for complete beginners
- **Motivation & Engagement** - Storytelling, case studies, and inspirational elements

## Installation

This expansion pack is not part of the official BMAD distribution. To install it, use the provided Makefile:

### Quick Installation

```bash
# From your project root
make install
```

This will:
- Install all necessary tools
- Run the expansion pack installation script automatically

The installation script:
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (Git Bash/WSL)
- Is idempotent (safe to run multiple times)
- Creates `.bmad-expert-author/` directory in your project root
- Copies all agents, tasks, templates, checklists, and data files
- Creates Claude Code slash commands in `.claude/commands/BMad/agents/`
- Updates `.bmad-core/install-manifest.yaml` to track the installation
- Automatically updates existing installations when run again

### Requirements

- BMAD-METHODâ„¢ core framework must be installed (`.bmad-core/` directory exists)
- For Claude Code users: `.claude/commands/` directory structure
- Bash-compatible shell (Linux, macOS, Git Bash on Windows, or WSL)

### What Gets Installed

After installation, you'll see the following in your project:

```
your-project/
â”œâ”€â”€ .bmad-core/                    # Core BMAD framework
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ install-manifest.yaml      # Updated with expansion pack info
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ .bmad-expert-author/           # Expansion pack files (NEW)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ agents/                    # Specialized agents
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tasks/                     # Task workflows
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates/                 # Document templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ checklists/                # Quality checklists
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/                      # Reference data (ADDIE framework, etc.)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ workflows/                 # Complete workflow guides
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # Expansion pack documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ .claude/                       # Claude Code integration (if using Claude Code)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ commands/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ BMad/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ agents/
â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ book-author.md
â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ book-strategist.md
â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ lector.md
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ ...            # All expansion pack agents
â””â”€â”€ expansion-packs/               # Source expansion packs
    â””â”€â”€ bmad-expert-author/        # This directory (source)
```

The `.bmad-expert-author/` directory is the working installation, while `expansion-packs/bmad-expert-author/` is the source that can be version-controlled and shared.

## Usage

### Activating Agents (Claude Code)

After installation, activate agents using slash commands with the configured prefix:

```bash
/BMad:agents:ea-book-strategist       # Create book strategy and planning
/BMad:agents:ea-researcher            # Gather and organize source materials
/BMad:agents:ea-learning-architect    # Design your book's learning framework
/BMad:agents:ea-book-author           # Write book content following specifications
/BMad:agents:ea-lector                # Review and provide quality feedback
/BMad:agents:ea-skill-analyzer        # Break down skills into teachable steps
/BMad:agents:ea-exercise-designer     # Create practical exercises
/BMad:agents:ea-case-study-curator    # Develop examples and stories
/BMad:agents:ea-content-structurer    # Organize your material
/BMad:agents:ea-clarity-editor        # Ensure beginner-friendly explanations
/BMad:agents:ea-workbook-developer    # Create companion materials
/BMad:agents:ea-publishing-strategist # Plan your launch
```

**Note**: The command prefix (e.g., `BMad:agents:`) is determined by your BMAD installation configuration. Check your `.claude/commands/` directory structure for the exact commands available in your environment.

### Using Agent Commands

Once an agent is activated, use their internal commands (prefixed with `*`):

```bash
*help                    # Show all available commands for the active agent
*create-book-blueprint   # Create a comprehensive book plan (book-strategist)
*write-chapter 1         # Write chapter 1 (book-author)
*review-chapter          # Review chapter content (lector)
*exit                    # Exit agent mode
```

## Core Workflow

The BMAD Expert Author workflow follows a structured process similar to software development:

```
1. Book Strategist â†’ Book Blueprint Document (BBD)
   Define target reader, transformation, unique approach, market positioning

2. Researcher â†’ Source Materials Inventory
   Gather and organize all author materials, references, stories, and resources

3. Learning Architect â†’ Learning Framework
   Design progressive skill building, learning outcomes, exercise strategy

4. Content Structurer â†’ Chapter Outlines
   Create detailed structure and chapter specifications

5. Book Author â†’ Content Writing
   Write chapters based on specifications

6. Lector â†’ Quality Review
   Comprehensive review and feedback cycle
```

## Key Success Principles

### 1. Don't Skip the Foundation
Invest time in Book Blueprint and Learning Framework first. The strategic foundation prevents major rework later.

### 2. Follow the Workflow
Each phase builds on the previous:
- BBD defines WHAT and WHY
- Learning Framework defines HOW
- Chapter outlines define SPECIFICALLY
- Writing executes the plan
- Lector ensures quality

### 3. Use the Lector Extensively
Quality reviews prevent publishing content that doesn't work:
- Review early and often
- Address feedback thoroughly
- Iterate until excellent

### 4. Work Chapter-by-Chapter
Don't write the entire book then review:
- Write one chapter
- Review and revise that chapter
- Get approval
- Move to next

This prevents cascading issues.

### 5. Think Like a Teacher, Not Just a Writer
Your job isn't just to share informationâ€”it's to enable transformation:
- Every chapter must have clear learning outcomes
- Exercises aren't optionalâ€”they're where learning happens
- Examples make abstract concepts concrete
- Assessments help readers measure progress

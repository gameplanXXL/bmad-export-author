# Task: Gather Source Materials

**Agent**: Researcher
**Output**: Source Materials Inventory
**Template**: source-materials-inventory-tmpl.md
**Output Path**: `docs/source-materials.md`
**Elicit**: true

## Purpose
Systematically collect, catalog, and organize all source materials, author expertise, references, and content resources that will inform the book's development.

## Prerequisites
- Completed Book Blueprint Document (BBD)
- Access to author's existing content and materials
- Understanding of book scope and topics

## Process

### Step 1: Introduction & Context Setting
**Elicit from user:**

```
I'm Regina, your Knowledge Curator and Research Specialist. My role is to help you gather and organize all the valuable source materials that will inform your book.

Before we dive in, let me explain why this matters:

Many authors have a wealth of existing content scattered across blog posts, presentations, course materials, and personal experiences. By systematically collecting and organizing these resources now, we:
- Avoid reinventing content you've already created
- Ensure no valuable insights are overlooked
- Build a searchable knowledge base for content creation
- Identify gaps where new content is needed
- Establish proper attribution and citations

This process typically takes 1-2 hours but saves weeks of work later.

Let's begin by reviewing your Book Blueprint to understand what we're gathering materials for.

│   ├── courses/
│   └── videos/
├── references/
│   ├── books/
│   ├── studies/
│   └── articles/
├── stories/
│   ├── personal-journey/
│   ├── client-cases/
│   └── examples/
├── existing-exercises/
│   ├── worksheets/
│   ├── templates/
│   └── tools/
└── media/
    ├── images/
    ├── diagrams/
    └── videos/

Please provide the actual files or links, and I'll help you organize them into this structure.
```

### Step 8: Quality Assessment & Gap Analysis

For each collected material:

1. **Assess Quality**:
   - Relevance to book topics (High/Medium/Low)
   - Current accuracy (Needs update? Still valid?)
   - Completeness (Ready to use? Needs development?)
   - Credibility (Well-sourced? Needs citations?)

2. **Map to Book Sections**:
   - Which chapters/topics does this support?
   - Primary or supporting material?
   - Directly usable or needs adaptation?

3. **Identify Gaps**:
   - Which book topics lack source materials?
   - What stories or examples are missing?
   - What research needs to be done?
   - What content must be created from scratch?

### Step 9: Create Source Materials Inventory

Using the template, create a comprehensive inventory document that includes:

1. **Catalog Sections**:
   - Author's Existing Content (organized by type)
   - Reference Materials (organized by category)
   - Stories & Case Examples (organized by theme)
   - Exercises & Practical Tools (organized by type)
   - Media Assets (organized by format)

2. **For Each Resource**:
   - Title/Description
   - Type/Format
   - Location/Link
   - Relevance Rating
   - Quality Assessment
   - Mapped Book Sections
   - Usage Notes
   - Permissions/Attribution

3. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Topics lacking source materials
   - Content that needs to be created
   - Research that needs to be conducted
   - Stories that need to be developed

4. **Quick Reference Guides**:
   - Resources by book chapter
   - Resources by content type
   - High-priority gaps to address

### Step 10: Present Inventory & Recommendations

Present completed inventory with:

1. **Executive Summary**:
   - Total resources collected
   - Coverage of book topics
   - Key strengths in source materials
   - Critical gaps identified

2. **Organization Overview**:
   - How materials are organized
   - How to find specific resources
   - File structure explanation

3. **Gap Analysis**:
   - What's missing
   - Priority gaps to address
   - Recommendations for filling gaps

4. **Usage Guidance**:
   - How content creators should use this inventory
   - Quick-reference guides
   - Update procedures

5. **Next Steps**:
   - Immediate actions needed
   - Research assignments
   - Content development priorities
   - Handoff to Learning Architect

## Output Deliverable

A comprehensive Source Materials Inventory saved as `docs/source-materials.md` containing:

- Complete catalog of all source materials
- Organized directory structure with actual files/links
- Quality assessment for each resource
- Mapping to book chapters/topics
- Gap analysis with priorities
- Usage guidelines for content creators

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All author's existing content identified and cataloged
- [ ] Personal stories and case examples documented
- [ ] Reference materials collected and assessed
- [ ] Existing exercises and tools inventoried
- [ ] All resources organized in logical directory structure
- [ ] Each resource tagged with relevance and quality ratings
- [ ] Resources mapped to relevant book sections
- [ ] Gaps clearly identified and prioritized
- [ ] Inventory document is searchable and navigable
- [ ] Content creators can easily find resources they need

## Handoff

Once Source Materials Inventory is complete:
- Learning Architect can assess available materials for instructional design
- Content Structurer knows what materials exist for each chapter
- Book Author has rich source material for content creation
- Exercise Designer can adapt existing exercises
- Case Study Curator has real stories to develop
- All agents work from common knowledge base

## Notes for Researcher

- **Be thorough but efficient**: Balance completeness with practical time constraints
- **Don't overwhelm**: If author has massive amounts of content, prioritize most relevant
- **Assess quality honestly**: Better to know now if materials need updating
- **Think ahead**: Organize for easy discovery during content creation
- **Identify gaps early**: Surface what's missing while there's time to address it
- **Preserve context**: Capture not just materials but why they're relevant
- **Enable reuse**: Help author leverage existing work rather than starting from scratch
- **Document systematically**: Future content creators will rely on this inventory

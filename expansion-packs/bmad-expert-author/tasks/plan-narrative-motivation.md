# Task: Plan Narrative Motivation

**Agent**: Reader Motivation (Maya)
**Output**: Comprehensive narrative motivation plan
**Elicit**: true

## Purpose
Create a master plan for applying narrative engagement techniques (Crisis Arc and/or Frame Story) across the entire book to boost reader motivation and emotional investment.

## Prerequisites
- Book Blueprint Document exists
- Learning Framework completed
- Chapter outlines created (book-structure.yaml or individual outlines)
- Understanding of book's transformation journey

## Process

### Step 1: Load Book Context

Read required documents:
```bash
# Book Blueprint
cat docs/book-blueprint.md

# Learning Framework
cat docs/learning-framework.md

# Book Structure
cat docs/book-structure.yaml

# Chapter Outlines
ls -la outlines/
```

Understand:
- Target audience and their pain points
- Transformation journey (before ‚Üí after state)
- Key learning objectives
- Number of chapters and structure
- Author's personal connection to topic

### Step 2: Elicit User Preferences

**CRITICAL - Elicit from user:**

```
I can help enhance reader engagement through two proven narrative techniques:

üìö **TECHNIQUE A: Crisis Arc (Asprey-Style)**
Personal journey of overcoming obstacles across multiple chapters.

Best for books where:
- You have a personal transformation story related to the topic
- Readers need hope and relatability
- The topic involves overcoming challenges
- You're comfortable sharing vulnerable moments

Example: David Asprey's journey from struggling with obesity and brain fog
to discovering biohacking solutions (spans entire book).

---

üìñ **TECHNIQUE B: Frame Story (Rahmengeschichte)**
Opening question/situation that's resolved at the end, with callbacks throughout.

Best for books where:
- You have a compelling client success story
- There's a central mystery or question to answer
- You want strong narrative structure
- The book builds toward a clear transformation

Example: Opening with "Can a 45-year-old mom of three achieve financial
freedom in 2 years?" and answering it at the end while teaching principles.

---

‚ùì **Which technique(s) would you like to use?**

1. **Technique A only** (Crisis Arc)
2. **Technique B only** (Frame Story)
3. **Both techniques** (Crisis Arc + Frame Story)
4. **Neither** (Skip narrative motivation techniques)

If you choose A or B (or both), I'll ask follow-up questions to design
the narrative arc specifically for your book.

**Your choice (1/2/3/4)?**
```

Wait for user response.

### Step 3a: If User Chooses Technique A (Crisis Arc)

**Elicit Crisis Arc Details:**

```
Great! Let's design your Crisis Arc (Asprey-Style).

This technique works best when it's YOUR authentic personal journey
related to the book's topic. It should span 5-8 chapters typically.

**Please share:**

1. **Your Personal Low Point** (Starting Crisis)
   - What was your biggest struggle with [book topic]?
   - When did you hit rock bottom?
   - What made this crisis relatable to your target readers?

   Example: "I was 40 pounds overweight, foggy-brained, and exhausted
   despite sleeping 8 hours. I'd tried every diet."

2. **Your Search & Experiments** (Failed Attempts)
   - What did you try first? (that didn't work)
   - What else did you experiment with?
   - How many major attempts/failures should we include? (3-5 recommended)

   List your failed experiments:
   - Attempt 1: [e.g., "Tried paleo diet - lost weight but brain fog remained"]
   - Attempt 2: [e.g., "Meditation - helped stress but not energy"]
   - Attempt 3: [etc.]

3. **Escalation** (How It Got Worse)
   - How did the situation deteriorate with failures?
   - What were the stakes? (health, relationships, career, etc.)

   Example: "After each failure, my confidence plummeted. My marriage
   was strained. I was missing my kids' events due to fatigue."

4. **Turning Point** (Aha Moment)
   - What finally changed? (discovery, insight, event)
   - When did this happen in your journey?
   - What made this breakthrough different?

   Example: "I discovered the connection between mitochondrial function
   and energy when I read a study on..."

5. **Transformation** (Your Success)
   - What changed after the breakthrough?
   - Concrete results? (numbers, before/after)
   - Timeline of improvement?

   Example: "Within 3 months: Lost 30 lbs, energy levels up 80%,
   brain fog gone, sleeping 6 hours and feeling better than ever."

6. **Chapter Mapping** (Where does each phase go?)
   - Which chapter introduces your crisis? (Usually Chapter 1 or 2)
   - Which chapters cover failed experiments? (Spread across middle)
   - Which chapter has the turning point?
   - Which chapter shows the transformation?

   Suggested default:
   - Ch 1-2: Personal Low Point
   - Ch 3-5: Search & Experiments (escalation)
   - Ch 6: Turning Point
   - Ch 7-8: Transformation & Learning

Please provide details for questions 1-6 above.
```

Wait for user response. Capture all details.

### Step 3b: If User Chooses Technique B (Frame Story)

**Elicit Frame Story Details:**

```
Excellent! Let's design your Frame Story (Rahmengeschichte).

A frame story opens with a compelling question or situation,
provides brief callbacks throughout, and resolves at the end.

**Please share:**

1. **Frame Story Type** - Which resonates with your book?

   a) **Personal Journey Frame**
      "How I went from [struggling] to [success]"
      Example: "How I went from $80k in debt to financially free"

   b) **Client Success Story Frame**
      "Will [Name] achieve [Goal]?"
      Example: "Can Sarah, a single mom of three, retire early?"

   c) **Mystery/Question Frame**
      "Why does [phenomenon] happen?"
      Example: "Why do 90% of diets fail, and how can you be in the 10%?"

   d) **Challenge Frame**
      "Can this [approach] actually work?"
      Example: "Can you really transform your health in just 12 weeks?"

   **Your choice (a/b/c/d)?**

2. **Opening Hook** (Prologue or Chapter 1)
   - What specific situation opens the frame?
   - What question needs answering?
   - What creates curiosity?

   Example (Client Story): "Sarah sat at her kitchen table, staring at
   $50,000 in credit card bills. Single mom of three, working two jobs,
   she felt hopeless. Could she ever achieve financial freedom?"

3. **Callback Schedule** (When to remind readers of frame)
   - How many chapters in your book? [Total: __]
   - Suggested callbacks: Every 2-3 chapters

   Default callback schedule:
   - Opening: Full frame introduction (300-500 words)
   - Chapter 3: Brief callback (50-100 words)
   - Chapter 5: Progress update (100-150 words)
   - Chapter 7: Continued progress (100-150 words)
   - Final chapter: Full resolution (300-500 words)

   Adjust this schedule? (yes/no, if yes provide your schedule)

4. **Frame Resolution** (How does it end?)
   - What's the answer to the opening question?
   - Concrete outcome/transformation?
   - Timeline of frame story? (weeks, months, years)

   Example: "Two years later, Sarah had paid off all $50k debt,
   built a 6-month emergency fund, and started investing. The same
   principles you've learned in this book transformed her life."

5. **Connection to Content** (How frame ties to teaching)
   - How does each chapter's content relate to frame story progress?
   - Does frame character use techniques taught in that chapter?

   Example: "In Chapter 3, when I teach budgeting, the callback shows
   Sarah implementing her first zero-based budget."

Please provide details for questions 1-5 above.
```

Wait for user response. Capture all details.

### Step 3c: If User Chooses Both Techniques

Elicit details for BOTH Technique A and Technique B as described in Steps 3a and 3b.

**CRITICAL**: Ensure techniques complement rather than compete:
- Crisis Arc = Author's personal journey
- Frame Story = Different story (client, case study, hypothetical)
- OR: Frame Story can BE the Crisis Arc (author's journey as frame)

Ask user:
```
You've chosen both techniques. How should they work together?

Option 1: **Separate Stories**
- Crisis Arc: Your personal journey (woven through chapters)
- Frame Story: Different story - client/case study (opens/closes book)

Option 2: **Unified Story**
- Frame Story IS your Crisis Arc (your personal journey as the frame)
- Opens with your crisis, resolves with your transformation
- Same story, different narrative structure

**Your preference (1 or 2)?**
```

### Step 4: Create Master Narrative Plan

Based on user's choices and details, create comprehensive plan.

**File**: `docs/narrative-motivation-plan.md`

```

### Step 5: Create Detailed Tracking Documents

Based on which technique(s) chosen:

**If Technique A (Crisis Arc):**
Create: `docs/crisis-arc-tracker.md`
- Detailed chapter-by-chapter tracking
- Emotional progression chart
- Verification checklist for each narrative element

**If Technique B (Frame Story):**
Create: `docs/frame-story-outline.md`
- Full frame story script (opening + callbacks + resolution)
- Callback timing and triggers
- Connection points to educational content

### Step 6: Automatically Commit Narrative Plan

**CRITICAL:** Automatically commit the narrative plan to Git:

```bash
mkdir -p docs
git add docs/narrative-motivation-plan.md
{if crisis arc:} git add docs/crisis-arc-tracker.md
{if frame story:} git add docs/frame-story-outline.md
git commit -m "Add narrative motivation plan

üî• Reader engagement techniques: {Technique A | Technique B | Both}
üìñ {Brief description of narrative approach}
‚úÖ Spans chapters {N}-{M} with {count} narrative touchpoints

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- DO commit automatically after creating plan
- DO NOT push automatically (user decides when to push)

### Step 7: Present Plan to User

Inform user:

```
‚úÖ Narrative Motivation Plan created!

üìã Master Plan: docs/narrative-motivation-plan.md
{if crisis arc:} üìà Crisis Arc Tracker: docs/crisis-arc-tracker.md
{if frame story:} üìñ Frame Story Outline: docs/frame-story-outline.md

üìä Summary:
- Technique(s): {List}
- Chapters involved: {Chapter range}
- Narrative touchpoints: {Count}
- Emotional arc: {Brief description}

üìù Next steps:
1. Review the narrative plan
2. Approve or request adjustments
3. I'll integrate narrative guidance into chapter outlines
4. book-author will weave narrative elements while writing
5. Run *verify-continuity after chapters are written to check consistency

‚úÖ Committed to Git (not pushed - you control when to push)

Would you like me to:
a) Integrate this narrative plan into your existing chapter outlines now?
b) Wait until you've reviewed and approved the plan?
c) Make adjustments to the plan first?
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] User preferences elicited (which technique(s), details gathered)
- [ ] Comprehensive narrative plan created
- [ ] Chapter-by-chapter breakdown provided
- [ ] Emotional arc designed and documented
- [ ] Tracking system established
- [ ] All narrative touchpoints mapped
- [ ] Writing guidance provided for book-author

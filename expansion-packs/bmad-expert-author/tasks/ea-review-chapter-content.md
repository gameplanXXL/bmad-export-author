## Creating the Review Report

### Feedback Structure

Organize feedback into categories:

#### 1. Overall Assessment
- Summary rating: Excellent | Good | Needs Revision | Significant Issues
- Overall strengths
- Overall areas for improvement
- Big-picture observations

#### 2. Critical Issues (Must Fix)
Issues that prevent approval:
- Missing learning outcomes
- Unclear core concepts
- Broken exercises
- Misalignment with BBD
- Major clarity problems

For each issue:
- **Location**: Specific page/section/paragraph
- **Issue**: What's wrong
- **Impact**: Why this matters
- **Fix**: Specific recommendation

#### 3. Important Issues (Should Fix)
Issues that significantly impact quality:
- Weak examples
- Pacing problems
- Engagement issues
- Minor misalignments

#### 4. Suggested Improvements (Nice to Have)
Enhancements that would strengthen content:
- Additional examples
- Refined explanations
- Better transitions
- Enhanced exercises

#### 5. Strengths
What's working well:
- Particularly clear explanations
- Excellent examples
- Effective exercises
- Strong opening/closing

### Feedback Best Practices

**Be Specific**:
- ‚ùå "This section is confusing"
- ‚úÖ "Paragraph 3 uses jargon ('cognitive load') without definition, likely confusing for beginners"

**Be Actionable**:
- ‚ùå "The example doesn't work"
- ‚úÖ "The example assumes readers have financial software, but BBD shows many readers are low-income. Suggest using a pen-and-paper budgeting example instead."

**Be Balanced**:
- Note both strengths and areas for improvement
- Recognize what's working well
- Frame critique constructively

**Prioritize**:
- Clearly separate must-fix from nice-to-have
- Focus on issues that impact learning effectiveness most
- Don't overwhelm with minor issues if major issues exist

## Approval Decision

Based on review, determine:

### ‚úÖ APPROVED
- All critical issues resolved
- Learning outcomes achieved
- Quality standards met
- Ready for next phase

### üîÑ APPROVED WITH MINOR REVISIONS
- No critical issues
- Few important issues that are quick fixes
- Author can address and resubmit specific sections

### ‚ùå NEEDS REVISION
- Critical issues present
- Significant rework required
- Author should address feedback and resubmit complete chapter

### ‚õî MAJOR ISSUES
- Fundamental problems (misaligned with BBD, missing learning outcomes)
- Requires rethinking approach
- May need consultation with Learning Architect

## Output Deliverable

**Review Report** containing:
1. Overall assessment and rating
2. Categorized feedback (Critical | Important | Suggested)
3. Specific, actionable recommendations
4. Strengths and positive observations
5. Approval decision
6. Next steps

Save as: `reviews/chapter-{NN}-review.md` (where NN is the zero-padded chapter number)

### Automatically Commit Review

**CRITICAL:** Automatically commit the review to Git:

```bash
git add reviews/chapter-{NN}-review.md
git commit -m "Add lector review for chapter {N}

üîç Quality review with specific feedback and recommendations
üìã Status: {APPROVED|NEEDS REVISION|etc.}

## Follow-up

After author revises:
1. **Verify Revisions**: Check that feedback was addressed
2. **Re-review Changed Sections**: Ensure fixes are effective

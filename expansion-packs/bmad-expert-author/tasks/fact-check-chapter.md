# Task: Fact-Check Chapter

**Agent**: Fact Checker (Viktor)
**Output**: Fact-check report with verified sources
**Elicit**: false

## Purpose
Comprehensively verify all factual claims in a chapter, find authoritative primary sources, and create a documented fact-check report.

## Prerequisites
- Chapter draft exists in `chapters/chapter-{NN}.md`
- Book Blueprint Document available
- Internet access for source research

## Process

### Step 1: Read Chapter Content

Load the chapter file:
```bash
# Read chapter
cat chapters/chapter-{NN}.md
```

Scan entire chapter for content overview.

### Step 2: Identify Factual Claims

Systematically search for claims requiring verification:

**Numerical Claims:**
- Percentages: "X% of...", "X percent..."
- Statistics: "X out of Y...", "X in Y..."
- Specific numbers: "X million people...", "costs $X..."
- Ranges: "between X and Y...", "X-Y%..."

**Research Claims:**
- "Studies show...", "Research indicates..."
- "According to researchers...", "Scientists found..."
- "Data reveals...", "Evidence suggests..."

**Expert/Authority Claims:**
- "According to [Name/Organization]..."
- "[Expert] says...", "[Organization] reports..."
- "As [Source] explains..."

**Historical/Date Claims:**
- "In [year]...", "Since [year]..."
- "During [period]...", "By [date]..."

**Comparative Claims:**
- "X is more/less than Y..."
- "X increased/decreased by Y%..."
- "Compared to...", "In contrast to..."

**Create Initial Claims List:**
```markdown
## Claims Found in Chapter {N}

1. **Claim**: "50% der Bev√∂lkerung leidet unter Stress"
   - Location: Paragraph 3, Section "Was ist Stress?"
   - Type: Percentage/Statistical claim
   - Status: Needs verification

2. **Claim**: "Studien zeigen, dass Meditation Blutdruck senkt"
   - Location: Paragraph 7, Section "Meditation als L√∂sung"
   - Type: Research claim
   - Status: Needs verification

[Continue for all claims...]
```

### Step 3: Research Primary Sources

For each claim, find authoritative sources:

**Search Strategy:**

1. **Use WebSearch** for recent studies:
   ```
   WebSearch: "[claim topic] peer reviewed study 2023 2024"
   WebSearch: "[claim] original research pubmed"
   WebSearch: "[statistic] official statistics government"
   ```

2. **Prioritize Source Types** (in order):
   - Peer-reviewed journal articles (PubMed, Google Scholar)
   - Government/official statistics (census, health departments)
   - Reports from authoritative organizations (WHO, World Bank, UN)
   - Books by recognized experts in field
   - Reputable news sources (citing original research)

3. **Verify Source Quality:**
   - Check publication date (recent preferred, <5 years for current topics)
   - Verify author credentials/affiliations
   - Check if peer-reviewed
   - Cross-reference with other sources
   - Avoid: Wikipedia, blogs, opinion pieces, marketing content

4. **Document Each Source:**
   ```markdown
   **Source for Claim 1:**
   - Title: "Stress Prevalence in European Populations: A Meta-Analysis"
   - Authors: Schmidt, M., et al.
   - Publication: Journal of Mental Health Research, 2023
   - DOI: 10.1234/jmhr.2023.12345
   - URL: https://journal-example.com/article/12345
   - Relevant finding: "49.7% of adults report chronic stress (n=50,000)"
   - Assessment: ‚úÖ Verified - claim is accurate
   ```

### Step 4: Verify Claim Accuracy

Compare each claim against found sources:

**Verification Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Verified**: Claim matches source accurately
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Needs Adjustment**: Claim slightly inaccurate, needs rewording
- ‚ùå **Unverified**: No reliable source found
- üîÑ **Outdated**: Source too old, needs recent data

**For Each Claim:**
```markdown
### Claim 1 Verification

**Original Claim**: "50% der Bev√∂lkerung leidet unter Stress"

**Source Found**: Schmidt et al., 2023 - European stress meta-analysis

**Accuracy Assessment**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs slight adjustment
- Source says: 49.7% (rounded to 50% is acceptable)
- Source scope: European adults, not global population
- Sample size: 50,000 participants across 15 countries

**Recommended Revision**:
"Fast die H√§lfte der europ√§ischen Erwachsenen (50%) leidet unter chronischem Stress[^1]"

**Citation**:
[^1]: Schmidt, M., et al. (2023). "Stress Prevalence in European Populations: A Meta-Analysis." *Journal of Mental Health Research*, 45(3), 234-256. DOI: 10.1234/jmhr.2023.12345
```

### Step 5: Create Fact-Check Report

Generate comprehensive report:

**File**: `resources/fact-checks/chapter-{NN}-facts.md`

**Structure**:
```markdown
# Fact-Check Report: Chapter {N} - {Chapter Title}

**Date**: {Current Date}
**Fact Checker**: Viktor (BMAD Fact Checker)
**Chapter File**: chapters/chapter-{NN}.md

## Detailed Fact-Check

### Claim 1: [Brief description]

### Step 7: Automatically Commit Fact-Check

**CRITICAL:** Automatically commit the fact-check report to Git:

```bash
mkdir -p resources/fact-checks resources/sources
git add resources/fact-checks/chapter-{NN}-facts.md
git add resources/sources/chapter-{NN}-sources.md
git commit -m "Add fact-check report for chapter {N}

üîç Verified {verified_count} claims with authoritative sources
üìö {total_sources} primary sources documented
‚úÖ Ready for citation integration

ü§ñ Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

**IMPORTANT:**
- DO commit automatically after completing fact-check
- DO NOT push automatically (user decides when to push)
- Include both fact-check report and bibliography

### Step 8: Present Report to User

Inform user:

```
‚úÖ Fact-check complete for Chapter {N}!

üìã Report: resources/fact-checks/chapter-{NN}-facts.md
üìö Sources: resources/sources/chapter-{NN}-sources.md

üìä Summary:
- {verified} claims verified ‚úÖ
- {needs_adjustment} need minor revision ‚ö†Ô∏è
- {unverified} could not be verified ‚ùå

üìù Next steps:
1. Review the fact-check report
2. Make recommended revisions to chapter
3. Use *add-citations {chapter_number} to add inline citations
4. Proceed to lector review

‚úÖ Committed to Git (not pushed - you control when to push)
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All numerical and factual claims identified
- [ ] Primary sources found for verifiable claims
- [ ] Source quality assessed (peer-reviewed, authoritative)
- [ ] Claim accuracy verified against sources
- [ ] Comprehensive fact-check report created
- [ ] Bibliography with complete citations generated
- [ ] Recommendations provided for unverified/problematic claims
- [ ] Reports automatically committed to Git (not pushed)
- [ ] User informed of findings and next steps

## Error Handling

**If source not found:**
- Search with alternative keywords
- Check if claim is "common knowledge" (still needs source)
- Flag for author to provide source or remove claim

**If source is paywalled:**
- Note DOI/URL for reference
- Search for open-access version
- Check author's institutional access
- Provide abstract/summary if full text unavailable

**If sources contradict each other:**
- Note conflicting sources in report
- Recommend most recent/authoritative source
- Suggest rewording claim to acknowledge debate

## Notes

- **Thoroughness over speed**: Better to check fewer claims well than many claims poorly
- **Document everything**: Even unsuccessful searches help author understand limitations
- **Be diplomatic**: Frame as helping author strengthen credibility, not criticizing
- **Cultural context**: Some statistics vary by country/region - be specific in claims

## Troubleshooting Guide

**If narrative feels forced:**
- Revisit authenticity - is story genuinely author's?
- Check length - might be too long
- Verify connection to content - is it relevant?

**If emotional arc falls flat:**
- Increase specificity and sensory details
- Ensure stakes are clear
- Check that transformation is earned, not sudden

**If readers confused:**
- Add clearer transitions
- Use formatting to distinguish narrative
- Reduce complexity - simpler story might work better

**If narrative overshadows content:**
- Reduce length of narrative elements
- Move some narrative to sidebars/boxes
- Consider using only key moments, not full arc

---

## Notes for Book Author

{Personalized guidance based on user's book and narrative choices}

**Key Reminders**:
- Write narrative elements from the heart - authenticity matters most
- Don't rush the emotional beats - let them breathe
- Trust the plan but stay flexible if better ideas emerge
- Check in with reader-motivation agent if unsure
- These techniques boost engagement, but teaching is still primary

**Narrative Writing Tips**:
- Use present tense for immediacy
- Show emotions through actions/sensations, not just naming them
- Concrete details > General statements
- Vulnerability creates connection - don't play it safe
- Balance despair with hope - even in dark moments, hint at possibility

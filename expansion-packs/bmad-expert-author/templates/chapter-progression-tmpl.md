## SECTION 3: SKILL BUILDING MATRIX

### Core Skills Across Chapters

| Skill | Ch 1 | Ch 2 | Ch 3 | Ch 4 | Ch 5 | Ch N |
|-------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| [Skill 1] | I | P | P | M | M | A |
| [Skill 2] | - | I | P | P | M | M |
| [Skill 3] | - | - | I | P | P | M |

**Legend**: I = Introduced, P = Practiced, M = Mastered, A = Advanced Application, - = Not covered

### Skill Progression Notes

## ✅ CORRECT Examples

### Checkmark Lists

**What You've Accomplished:**

- ✅ Built your first 10-station Memory Palace
- ✅ Created vivid mental images
- ✅ Linked images with locations through interaction
- ✅ Applied the technique in real work situations
- ✅ Achieved 90%+ recall accuracy

### Numbered Lists

**Your Next Steps:**

1. Review your baseline assessment from Chapter 1
2. Compare with your current abilities
3. Celebrate every improvement
4. Plan your 90-day mastery roadmap
5. Commit to daily practice

### Mixed Checkmark Types

**Mastery Criteria:**

- ✅ **Passed:** New palace built in under 10 minutes
- ✅ **Passed:** 10 items encoded successfully
- ✅ **Passed:** Immediate recall 9/10 correct
- ⏸️ **In Progress:** 24h recall 7/10 (needs improvement)
- ❌ **Not Yet:** Real-world application pending

### Nested Lists

**Maintenance Schedule:**

- **Weekly Tasks:**
  - Use palaces for work meetings
  - Review important permanent palaces (5 min)
  - Encode at least 3 new pieces of information
- **Monthly Tasks:**
  - Build 1-2 new palaces
  - Learn something new using palaces
  - Teach someone else the basics
- **Quarterly Tasks:**
  - Re-read key chapters from this book
  - Set new memory goals
  - Evaluate progress and adjust

### Complex Nested Lists

**90-Day Plan:**

1. **Days 31-60: Fluency Phase**
   - Practice 15-20 min daily
   - New applications:
     - Learn vocabulary for language
     - Memorize professional frameworks
     - Build client-specific palaces
   - Weekly review of technique

2. **Days 61-90: Mastery Phase**
   - Practice 10-15 min daily
   - Advanced techniques:
     - PAO system exploration
     - Journey method for long content
     - Teaching others
   - Monthly deep practice session

### Tables

| Metric | Day 1 | Day 30 | Improvement |
|--------|-------|--------|-------------|
| Names at Event | 3-5 | 20-25 | 4-5× |
| Free Presentation | No | Yes | ✅ |
| Info Overload (1-10) | 8 | 3 | -5 |
| Time Searching Notes (min) | 15 | 2 | -13 min |

### Blockquotes

**Inspirational Quote:**

> "The sweet sound for any person is their own name."
> — Dale Carnegie

**Personal Story:**

> When I first started using Memory Palaces, I was skeptical. "This seems too simple," I thought. But after just one week, I memorized 15 names at a networking event. The technique works because it aligns with how our brains naturally function.

### Code Blocks

**Major System Example:**

```
48 = R + F = Raffe (Giraffe)
15 = T + L = Telefon (Phone)
2910 = N + P + T + S = Neptun (Neptune)
```

**Transformation Pattern:**

```markdown
Normal Name → Visualization
Michael Schneider → Michel Angelo with giant scissors
Anna Klein → Tiny pineapple (Ananas klein)
```

### Horizontal Rules

Use `---` for section breaks:

---

## Section Break Example

Text continues here after visual separator.

---

### Definition Lists (if supported)

**Term 1**
: Definition or explanation of term 1

**Term 2**
: Definition or explanation of term 2

---

## ❌ INCORRECT Examples (Avoid These!)

### Inline Checkmarks - BAD

✅ 20-25 Namen merken ✅ Freie Präsentationen ✅ 10+ Palaces ✅ Real-Time Encoding ✅ Alle Daten korrekt

**Problem:** Everything runs together in one line. Hard to scan. Unprofessional.

### No Empty Lines Before List - BAD

```markdown
Here is some text about the topic.
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
And here is more text.
```

**Problem:** Markdown may not render the list correctly.

### Mixed List Syntax - BAD

```markdown
- Item 1
* Item 2
+ Item 3
- Item 4
```

**Problem:** Inconsistent. Pick ONE syntax (`-`) and stick with it.

### Incorrect Nested Indentation - BAD

```markdown
- Parent Item
   - Child Item (3 spaces - wrong!)
    - Another Child (4 spaces - wrong!)
  - Yet Another (1 space - wrong!)
```

**Problem:** Use exactly 2 spaces for each indentation level.

### Headers Without Hierarchy - BAD

```markdown
# Chapter Title
### Subsection (skipped H2)
## Main Section (out of order)
```

**Problem:** Always follow H1 → H2 → H3 order. Don't skip levels.

## 🎯 Quick Reference: Formatting Rules

### Lists
1. ✅ Always add empty line BEFORE list
2. ✅ Always add empty line AFTER list
3. ✅ Use Markdown syntax (`- ` or `1. `)
4. ✅ Checkmarks as list items: `- ✅ Item`
5. ❌ Never inline: `✅ Item1 ✅ Item2`
6. ✅ Nested: 2-space indentation per level

### Headers
1. ✅ Follow hierarchy: H1 → H2 → H3
2. ✅ No punctuation at end
3. ✅ Descriptive and clear
4. ❌ Don't skip levels

### Emphasis
1. ✅ **Bold** for key terms: `**text**`
2. ✅ *Italic* for emphasis: `*text*`
3. ✅ `Code` for technical terms: `` `text` ``
4. ❌ Don't overuse (every other word)

### Links
1. ✅ Inline: `[text](url)`
2. ✅ Reference: `[text][ref]` then `[ref]: url`
3. ✅ Descriptive text (not "click here")

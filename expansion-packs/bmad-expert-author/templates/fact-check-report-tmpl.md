- Demographic data: Census, UN, official statistics
- Scientific claims: Primary research papers
- Historical facts: Authoritative historical sources

**Limitations**:
- Some specialized claims may require domain expert verification
- Access to paywalled sources limited to abstracts/summaries
- Non-English sources translated via available tools

**Confidence Statement**:
{I am confident that all verified claims are accurate based on current available sources. Claims marked as "needs adjustment" or "unverified" require author attention before publication.}

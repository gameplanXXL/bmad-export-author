## 5. Transformation Story Internal Consistency

**Check the transformation story for logical consistency:**

## 7. Client Story Consistency (if applicable)

**For each client success story documented:**

- [ ] Lessons from client story align with lessons in your transformation story

### Anonymization Consistency (if client is anonymized)
- [ ] Pseudonym used consistently throughout the story

**If inconsistencies found:**

- Issue: _______________________________
- Resolution: _______________________________

## Tips for Maintaining Consistency

1. **Establish "source of truth" early**: For each fact (years of experience, credentials, numbers), decide which document is authoritative and reference it when in doubt.

2. **Use exact copy-paste for key facts**: Don't retype numbers or dates - copy from source of truth to ensure consistency.

3. **Update all documents when facts change**: If you earn a new credential or update client numbers, update ALL relevant documents at once.

4. **Version control is your friend**: Commit changes to git so you can track when discrepancies were introduced.

5. **Review before major uses**: Before launching book, updating website, or preparing media kit, run this consistency check.
